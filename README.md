# Physics-Inspired Sales Analysis 📈⚛️

This project explores sales data from a physics-inspired perspective using Python and Pandas.

## 🔍 What's Inside
- **Time Series Resampling**: Weekly and monthly views of sales data
- **Visual Insights**: Clean plots with `matplotlib` (dark mode!)
- **Creative Thinking**: Interpreting business data through the lens of motion, flow, and rhythm—like physics.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Structure
- `data/`: Raw CSV data
- `notebooks/`: Main notebook
- `plots/`: Exported visualizations
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies

## 🚀 Run it yourself
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Open the notebook and run it cell by cell!
